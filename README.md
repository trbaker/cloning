# cloning
Python Notebooks with sample ArcGIS Online content cloning.

Upload these Python notebooks into your ArcGIS Online organization, where you have publisher or administrator priveleges.  Add your ArcGIS Organization URL, username, password.  Cloning will not copy new StoryMaps (2020+), map services, or image services. 

"Your mileage may vary." As the API upgrades over time, expect improvements in capacity.  For more information about the Python API for ArcGIS Online:
